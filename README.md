# Barry O Sullivan's blog

I'm changing this blurb because the last one was embarassing. Here's a much simpler one that isn't quite so full of humble brags.

## Who am I?
Barry O Sullivan, developer, writer (apparently), lover of games and irreverant TV shows. Also, I currently look like a homeless sea captain.

### What I've done
Who cares? This isn't a place for pitching myself, it's a place for me to store the stuff I've written and maybe a place for other people to read interesting things. If you really want to see what I've done (in the pitchiest way possible), go to [my linkedin profile](https://ie.linkedin.com/in/barryosu).

# Articles
This repo contains my writings and ranting on topics related to software development. Hope you find it interesting.
