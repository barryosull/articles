#Barry O Sullivan's blog

"A blog, on github?!" (Yes, I'm imagining your monocle popping out as you exclaim this)

I've started writing again and I wanted somewhere to host my files, I also wanted the files to be written in Mardown and I really didn't want to write another custom blog project. Github meets my needs, why not use it?

## Who am I?
For those of you that stumbled upon this repo, my name is Barry O Sullivan. I am software developer with over 11 years experience building web applications. My languages of choice are PHP, Javascript and Java. 

I like to think of myself as a one man dev team, as I can do the full stack, from PHP server side to JS client side. Through in some android development on top of this, and you can see what I mean.

### What I've done
So enough about the casual bragging, let's move onto the serious bragging. What have I actually done and what am I proud off? 

For my current client, I've built an event sourced, CQRS server app with multiple sub-domains (DDD term, think of microservices, but geared around domain language, not dev language). There are then three web applications and one android application that use those domains. The architecture is very clean, allowing for rapid iteration. 

I've written a PHP ValueObject library that allows you to rapdidly build new valueobjects, it essentially a toolkit.

I've written an ES5 dependency injection library that has proven very useful. I'm big into OOP. so I got fed up with Javascript not having interfaces, so I wrote a library to solve it. It does a lot of other neat stuff too.

I write DSLs (Domain Specific Languages) and their parsers, recently I wrote one to handle encoding and decoding client requests, saved my team a lot of time.

I organise PHPDublin, Ireland's largest PHP meetup group. I look after speakers and occasionaly speak myself.

I'm part of an open source group that is building an event sourcing framework for PHP.

I mentor startups in software development, primarily architecture and design.
